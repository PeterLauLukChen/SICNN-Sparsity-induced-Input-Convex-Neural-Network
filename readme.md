# [NeurIPS 2024 OPT] SICNN: Sparsity-induced Input Convex Neural Network for Optimal Transport

**Peter Chen, Yue Xie, Qingpeng Zhang**

## Implementation
This module contains three different methods as shown in the paper:
1) Low dimensional setting with constant sparsity: 2_dim_constant_intensity
2) Low dimensional setting with dynamic heuristic adjustment: 2_dim_SA
3) High dimensional setting (RGD method and SICNN method): high_dim

Datasets shown in the paper are included in each folder.
